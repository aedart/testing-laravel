## Testing-Laravel ##

Utilities that allows you to test Laravel dependent packages. At its core, this package is a wrapper for the Orchestral Testbench.
However, you can make use of this with whatever testing framework you wish; it does not impose you to use neither Orchestral's nor Laravel's TestCase classes.
